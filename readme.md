# Getting Started with The N2 Starter Skin 
The purpose of this skin is to allow for easy, responsive theme development on the N2 eCommerce platform.

## Editing Styles
All of the your project styles should be added to the appropriate SASS file in the SCSS folder. Use your favorite CSS preprocessor client (such as prepros, koala, codekit, etc..) to output the main.scss file to design.css. Your outputted design.css file should be minified and autoprefixed.

## Editing Templates/HTML
All of the available template edits can be found in the "inc" folder. If you cannot make the edits you need you will need to use javascript to edit the DOM on page load and/or put in a request with Dave to enable the functionality needed.
