<h2 id="editing-styles">Editing Styles</h2>
<p>All of your project styles should be added to the appropriate SASS file in the SCSS folder. Use your favorite CSS preprocessor client (such as prepros, koala, codekit, etc..) to output the main.scss file to design.css. Your outputted design.css file should be minified and autoprefixed.</p>
<h2 id="editing-templates-html">Editing Templates/HTML</h2>
<p>All of the available template files can be found in the &quot;inc&quot; folder. If you cannot make the edits you need you will need to use javascript to edit the DOM on documemt ready and/or put in a request with Dave to enable the functionality needed.</p>
<h2 id="skin-installation">Skin Installation</h2>
<p>To use this skin, rename the folder to your desired name (typically the client&#39;s name) and move the renamed folder to &quot;/assets/design/&quot; on the server. Once complete, you will then be able to select the skin in the client&#39;s N2 portal. Customize to your hearts content!</p>
